# Ship Faster with AI-Powered Code Review

*Your new AI teammate catches bugs in 60 seconds—so your human reviewers can focus on what matters.*

---

We've all been there. You finish a feature, open a pull request, and then... you wait. Your teammates are deep in their own work. The review queue is backed up. And that "quick fix" sits there for two days.

For most development teams, code reviews have become a bottleneck. Our data shows developers wait an average of **47 hours** for PR reviews. That's nearly two full days of blocked progress—for every single PR.

**Today, we're excited to announce AI-Powered Code Review**—an intelligent assistant that analyzes your code in seconds, catching bugs and security issues before your human reviewers even open the PR.

---

## The Challenge

Code review is essential. It catches bugs, spreads knowledge, and maintains quality. But it's also a tax on your team's time.

Senior engineers—often your best reviewers—spend up to 30% of their time reviewing others' code. That's time they're not building new features or mentoring teammates.

And for the developers waiting? Context has moved on. By the time feedback arrives, they've started something new. The mental cost of switching back adds up.

We needed a way to keep the benefits of code review while removing the bottleneck.

## Introducing AI-Powered Code Review

When you submit a pull request, AI analyzes your code in under 60 seconds. It checks for:

- **Bugs**: Null pointer issues, off-by-one errors, resource leaks
- **Security vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets
- **Style violations**: Based on your team's standards

Suggestions appear inline, right in your PR diff. Hover to see why. Click to fix. Simple.

### Faster Feedback, Better Code

Your human reviewers still review your code—but now they see cleaner code with fewer basic issues. They can focus on architecture, design, and business logic instead of catching typos.

In our beta testing, teams saw:
- **50% reduction** in PR wait time
- **40% of issues** caught by AI before human review
- **Higher reviewer satisfaction**—less tedious, more meaningful reviews

### Your Code, Your Rules

Not every suggestion applies to every team. That's why admins can:
- Enable or disable specific checks
- Link your team's style guide
- Exclude certain file patterns

AI adapts to how *your* team works.
